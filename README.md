**Project Title:** BMW Sales & Market Analysis
**Completion Date:** August 2025

**Overview**
This project explores patterns in BMW vehicle sales and evaluates factors influencing performance through predictive modeling and correlation analysis. It aims to provide insights into market behavior and identify the most impactful features driving sales outcomes.

**Objectives**
- Explore and visualize historical BMW sales data
- Identify variables most correlated with sales performance
- Build and evaluate regression models to forecast sales
- Compare model accuracy and interpret feature contributions

**Methods**
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Trend charts, outlier detection, and summary statistics
- Correlation Analysis: Pearson correlation coefficients to assess feature influence
- Predictive Modeling: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Model Evaluation: RÂ² and RMSE metrics to compare model performance

**Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Feature Importance Analysis

**Key Findings**
- Vehicle price, marketing spend, and customer satisfaction score were strongly correlated with monthly sales.
- XGBoost outperformed both Linear Regression and Random Forest in predictive accuracy.
- The models confirmed the non-linear relationship between certain features (like discounts and sales volume), supporting the use of advanced tree-based models.

**Ethical Considerations**
- Data was anonymized and simulated to avoid privacy concerns.

Care was taken to interpret model results responsibly and avoid overfitting.

Predictive insights were framed as support tools for strategic planning, not guarantees.
